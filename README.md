Naive Bayes algorithm implementation with Log Probabilities
 
The Naive Bayes algorithm has been implemented is separately for the three data sets.

The accuracy of the Naive Bayes algorithm using 10-Fold cross validation on the three datasets from the UCI-Machine Learning Repository
is compared with that obtained with Naive Bayes from Weka.

1.	Hayes-Roth Dataset

NaÃ¯ve Bayes algorithm has been implemented with Log probabilities.

Results from the model:

Accuracy at fold  1  is : 0.5714285714285714

Accuracy at fold  7  is : 0.6923076923076923
Accuracy at fold  8  is : 0.7692307692307693
Accuracy at fold  9  is : 0.8461538461538461
Accuracy at fold  10  is : 0.6153846153846154
Total Accuracy :  71.1538 %

Accuracy from Weka: 76.51 %

3.	Breast Cancer Data set

Data preprocessing: During the initial data processing, all the column values has been converted to integer values as below. Also, the rows with missing attributes are removed to avoid unusual behavior. Since the data is already sorted based on Class, the data, during the program execution, is sorted using Column 3.

New values for

Column1 are,
[no-recurrence-events] => 1
[recurrence-events] => 2

Column 2 are,
[50-59] => 1
[30-39] => 2
[70-79] => 3
[20-29] => 4
[40-49] => 5
[60-69] => 6

Column 3 are,
[lt40] => 1
[ge40] => 2
[premeno] => 3

Column 4 are,
[10-14] => 1
[35-39] => 2
[45-49] => 3
[40-44] => 4
[5-9] => 5
[50-54] => 6
[0-4] => 7
[15-19] => 8
[30-34] => 9
[20-24] => 10
[25-29] => 11

Column 5 are,
[24-26] => 1
[9-11] => 2
[6-8] => 3
[3-5] => 4
[15-17] => 5
[12-14] => 6
[0-2] => 7

Column 6 are,
[no] => 1
[yes] => 2

Column 7 are,
[3] => 1
[1] => 2
[2] => 3

Column 8 are,
[right] => 1
[left] => 2

Column 9 are,
[right_up] => 1
[right_low] => 2
[central] => 3
[left_up] => 4
[left_low] => 5

Column 10 are,
[no] => 1
[yes] => 2
